I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building clean, fast, and useful software—from Redis clones in C++ to full-stack platforms for students prepping DSA. I enjoy diving deep into systems-level programming as much as crafting intuitive user experiences with React and Tailwind.

Currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I’ve built projects ranging from job tracking tools to CAPTCHA breakers using TensorFlow. I like working across the stack, solving problems that matter, and learning things the hard (and fun) way.

Lately, I’ve been experimenting with Clang plugins, CI pipelines, and the occasional weird side project. Outside of code, I have a soft spot for Raspberry Pi experiments and spicy takeout.
